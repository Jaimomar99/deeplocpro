# DeepLocPro 1.0


####  Prediction of subcellular localization of proteins in prokaryotes.
----------------------------
The DeepLocPro 1.0 server is a multiclass subcellular localization prediction tool for prokaryotic proteins, trained on experimentally verified data curated from Uniprot and PSORTdb. 
DeepLocPro has been trained to work with prokaryotic proteins from a wide range of organisms covering Archaea, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. 
It can differentiate between six different localizations: Cell wall & surface, Extracellular, Cytoplasmic, Cytoplasmic membrane, Outer membrane and Periplasmic.

The DeepLocPro 1.0 server requires protein sequence(s) in fasta format, and can not handle nucleic acid sequences.

Refer to the publication for details on the model's architecture and its performance: [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.04.574157v1)
