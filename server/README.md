# DeepLocPro 1.0


####  Prediction of subcellular localization of proteins in prokaryotes.
----------------------------
The DeepLocPro 1.0 server is a multiclass subcellular localization prediction tool for prokaryotic proteins, trained on experimentally verified data curated from Uniprot and PSORTdb. 
DeepLocPro has been trained to work with prokaryotic proteins from a wide range of organisms covering Archaea, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. 
It can differentiate between six different localizations: Cell wall & surface, Extracellular, Cytoplasmic, Cytoplasmic membrane, Outer membrane and Periplasmic.

The DeepLocPro 1.0 server requires protein sequence(s) in fasta format, and can not handle nucleic acid sequences.
