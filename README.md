DeepLocPro 1.0
===========

DeepLocPro 1.0 is a multiclass subcellular localization prediction tool for prokaryotic proteins, trained on experimentally verified data curated from Uniprot and PSORTdb. DeepLocPro has been trained to work with prokaryotic proteins from a wide range of organisms covering Archaea, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. It can differentiate between six different localizations: Cell wall & surface, Extracellular, Cytoplasmic, Cytoplasmic membrane, Outer membrane and Periplasmic.

Additionally DeepLocPro can predict the presence of the sorting signal(s) that had an influence on the prediction of the subcellular localization(s).

The DeepLocPro 1.0 server requires protein sequence(s) in fasta format, and can not handle nucleic acid sequences.

Pre-installation
----------------

DeepLocPro 1.0 will run and has been tested under Linux and OS X. The only prerequisite is to have python3.6 or above installed.


Installation
------------

The installation procedure is:


  1. Install DeepLocPro 1.0 package:
        pip install deeplocpro.tar.gz
     or within the deeplocpro directory:
         pip install .

  2. Test DeepLoc 2.1 by running:
     deeplocpro -f test.fasta
     
     the result should look like the file in the 'output' directory

This will download only the 'Fast' model (ESM1b). The 'Accurate' model (ProtT5) uses more memory (approx. 32GB), therefore, it is not recommended for personal computers with limited memory. The 'Accurate' model will be downloaded the first time that the user chooses it at run time.

Running
--------

DeepLoc will be installed under the name 'deeplocpro'. It has 4 possible arguments:

 * -f, --fasta. Input protein sequences in the fasta format.
 * -o, --output. Output folder name.
 * -p, --plot. Plot and save attention values for each individual protein. 
 * -d, --device. One of cpu, cuda or mps. Default: cpu.
 * -g, --group. Prevent outer membrane & periplasm prediction when Archaea/positive. One of any, archaea, positive or negative. Default: any

Output
-------

The output is a comma separated file with the following format:

 * 1st column: Protein ID.
 * 2nd column: Predicted localization(s).
 * 3rd-8column: Probability for each of the individual localizations. 

If --plot is defined, a plot and a text file with the sorting signal importance for each protein will be generated.
